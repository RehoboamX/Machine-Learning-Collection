"""
Walk through of a lot of different useful Tensor Operations, where we
go through what I think are four main parts in:

1. Initialization of a Tensor
2. Tensor Mathematical Operations and Comparison
3. Tensor Indexing
4. Tensor Reshaping

But also other things such as setting the device (GPU/CPU) and converting
between different types (int, float etc) and how to convert a tensor to an
numpy array and vice-versa.
